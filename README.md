Written in python for reddit using the PRAW. This script has a comment displaying where the variables should be changed for beginners. Future improvements would be to change the wallpaper as well.

Credit goes to u/lickmyspaghetti in https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/5benxs/how_do_i_download_an_image_using_praw/. All I did was update his script and comment it.
